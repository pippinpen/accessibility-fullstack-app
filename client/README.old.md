THIS IS THE CLIENT SIDE APP.

Client side app that configures the form data.
The form data is stored in the server and conditionally rendered to the client side app.
The client side app recieves a key for the form.
The user side app uses the key to pull up the form.
The form data is sent back to the server.
The client side app can see a summary of the data that the users have filled out from the server.

Or so we hope!
